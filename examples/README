Running the examples locally in Firefox
=======================================

Because of Firefox's restrictive default settings, you may receive a security 
error when trying to load the examples.  To get around this, you need to modify
Firefox's configuration by following these steps:

1) type about:config in the address bar

2) Find the setting security.fileuri.strict_origin_policy and change it to false.
